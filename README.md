This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the `calc()` function in CSS.  The problem arises when `calc()` is used to determine the width or height of an element based on a percentage of its parent container's dimensions, but the parent container's width or height is not explicitly defined. The solution provides a fix by ensuring the parent container has a defined width or height, allowing the `calc()` function to operate correctly.
